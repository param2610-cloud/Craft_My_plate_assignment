Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.


Follow these development principles for all code and design:

1. Write readable, human-focused code. Prefer clarity over autogenerated blocks.
2. Reason about the logic rather than relying on raw syntax shortcuts.
3. Choose clear, organized structure over quick or compact code.
4. Apply Clean Architecture: routing → controller → service → model/repository.
5. Maintain encapsulation. Avoid monolithic controllers; keep modules small and focused.
6. Use meaningful, descriptive naming. Add short comments where useful.
7. Return proper HTTP status codes and consistent, structured error responses.
8. Use environment variables for all configuration, especially database and secrets.

All code must follow these principles by default.
